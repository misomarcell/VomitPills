# VomitPills
This is my imaginary product. I implemented all the SI-Week assignments with this site.

# HOMEPAGE
Basic HTML page with HTML 1.1 tags, CSS formats and some fontawesome icons. You can also found a youtube embed there.

# PRE-ORDER
Nothing special, an order page look-a-like, currently not working, only there for the show.

# VARIANTS
Because the forst assignment told me to use TABLE tags, I did it there.

# FEEDBACK
The last assignment works there. You can send a message and it'll show above with the others. It works with the Message.java file.

# CONTACT
Another useless page.

# NEWSLETTER
I implemented the second assignment there, so you can type in your e-mail address, click on subscribe and with the Subscribe.java it'll send the given address to the serverlet.
